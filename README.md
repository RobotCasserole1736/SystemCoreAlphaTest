# SystemCoreAlphaTest

Codebase for the 2025 SystemCore Alpha test. This codebase is targeted at our Practice Bot which, while fairly barebones, still ~~is very cursed~~ has great test coverage:

1) a mix of Rev and Kraken motors on every swerve drive module
2) Pulse-width absolute encoders on the azimuth sensors (horray COVID supply chain constraints that turned into technical inertia)
3) A whole website that the robot code hosts
4) A javscript client talking to ntcore on the new SystemCore
5) A completely custom swerve control implementation in python
6) Repulsor-field on-the-fly navigation
7) A vertically-mounted RIO
